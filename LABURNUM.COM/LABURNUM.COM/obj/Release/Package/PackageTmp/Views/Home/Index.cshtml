            <p><span>LABURNUM PUBLIC SCHOOL (Coeducation) was founded in 2013. We opened it in the memory of Pt. Mahavir Prasad who really wants to spread the awareness of education among the people and educate the upcoming generation. So we present it as a Pt. Mahavir Prasad Education Memorial Society. We have also opened the Triveni Devi Education Trust. We aim to provide education in the ideal environment, surrounded by greenery and to create a next - generation leaders with high ideals and humanity.</span></p>
            <p>It is widely agreed that there is no place like private school to obtain a superior quality education, and our original educational method is well received. Combining both homely warmth and strict discipline in our school community, brings about a mutual respect relationship with teachers while enhancing students character developments.
